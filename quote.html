<h2>The Rossoneri - Quote</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
With one part Salford and two parts south Manchester, The Rossoneri are definitely singing from a local hymn sheet. Add to the mix the evocative and extremely sentimental lyrics of BBC poet for Manchester Mike Duff and you're almost there. <p/>

<p>
Singer and guitarist Rob Mager said: &quot;Myself and Phil (whistles/bodhrán) were in Manchester/Irish band <i>Cairde</i> for four years. We enjoyed apperances on <i>BBC GMR</i> and <i>Granada Tonight</i> before the Emerald Isle came calling and stole away two of our members.
We needed a fresh start and on New Year's Eve this year after a few beers we came up with the idea of roping in Mike and Jenny (violin).<p/>

<p>
&quot;Mike's written a set of poems called <i>'the drunken lulabies'</i> which we have turned into songs in their own right.
The sound draws a lot on irish influences with the story-telling element of Mike's lyrics featuring heavily. <i>The Pogues</i>, <i>The Smiths</i> and <i>Bob Dylan</i> are good reference points.&quot;</p>

<p>
Fast forward eight months and the band now have a strong set of gigs under their belts. Highlights range from an intimate gig at Chorlton's Iguana Bar to a rather boistrous St Patrick's Day set at central Liverpool pub <i>The Excelsior</i>. 
Phil remembers, &quot;All these burly gaelic football fans from Galway were over and were jumping around down at the front. The place was literaly shaking!&quot;
Such scenes are not likely to be repeated during the <i>M19</i> gig due to the acoustic nature of the show, but don't let that put you off catching a very entertaining performance from one of Manchester's freshest new bands...
