# _The Rossoneri_ website archive, 2005 - 2007

This is the website for the acoustic modern and folk band, _The Rossoneri_, who were together between 2005 and 2007. 
They often played folk rock with a rhythm section called Extraordinary Rendition. 
They were based in Manchester, UK.

This archive is maintained out of historical interest for the Manchester music scene in the 2000s. 
It also serves as a test for website hosting options from [Duck Whistle](https://duckwhistle.com), 
and as a reminder of web design practices 20 years ago.
